;;; codex-ide-diff-view.el --- Diff buffer views for codex-ide -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026

;; Author: Duncan Gillis

;;; Commentary:

;; This module owns dedicated diff-buffer presentation for Codex file changes.
;;
;; It turns Codex-provided patch text into a standalone `diff-mode' buffer and
;; displays that buffer using codex-ide's normal window policy.  Keeping this
;; separate from transcript control lets the transcript layer stay focused on
;; when a diff should be offered while this module owns how the diff is shown.
